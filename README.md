title: "AI-Generated Officer Profiles for Experimental Research"
---

## Overview
This project accompanies the manuscript *AI-Generated Human Stimuli for Experimental Social Science* (Robinson et al. 2025).  
We validate AI-generated police officer profiles as experimental stimuli in a 4 × 2 × 3 factorial design (race × gender × somatotype).  

## Key Points
- **Stimuli**: AI-generated officer headshots, varied systematically.  
- **Tasks**:  
  1. Trait recognition  
  2. Trait change detection  
  3. Impression ratings (competence, agency, warmth)  
- **Sample**: 500 Prolific participants, 2,565 ratings.  
- **Findings**:  
  - High accuracy in identifying intended traits  
  - Reliable detection of manipulations  
  - Impression ratings reproduced known stereotypes (e.g., mesomorph advantage, warmth bias by gender/race).
